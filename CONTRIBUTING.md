# Contributing to SQRL-Qt

Contributions welcome! To make things easier, please try to follow this process:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub. (Be sure to fork [this one](https://github.com/sqrl-qt/sqrl-qt), and not someone's personal fork.)
2. Clone your fork (e.g. `git clone git@github.com:<user>/sqrl-qt`), and add this repo as a remote (e.g. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sqrl-qt/sqrl-qt.git).
3. Create an appropriately named branch (e.g. `git branch -b feature/myCoolFeature`).
4. Code!
5. If necessary, pull from upstream, and rebase your branch. (Currently, the main branch is `master`, but I will soon be moving to [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).) Don't make me deal with merge conflicts!
6. Push your branch to your fork.
7. Submit a pull request. If it is non-trivial, be sure to add a description to tell me what it does. (But you did that in your commit messages anyway, right?)
8. Profit!
