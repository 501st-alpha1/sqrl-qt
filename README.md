sqrl-qt
=======

(Eventually) a fully functional Qt client for Steve Gibson's SQRL (Simple Quick Reliable Login). Pull requests welcome!

Currently I am focused on getting things to work, which means implementing the back-end, so the UI will probably be rather unorganized. Once I have everything working, I will try to refactor that.
